# Recruiter-Notes-for-Tony-Bosco
Here are a few key areas I would be excited to apply my skills to in the future...


#### I’m an experienced *Marketing Executive* who is also proud to have earned the title of *Data Scientist*.


-  	I am thrilled that having a large intellectual arsenal at my disposal that allows me to develop new strategic and creative approaches to significantly impact target audiences. 
-  	I’m at my best when I am helping teams succeed in reaching their goals, and organizations succeed in fulfilling their missions. 
-  	I am looking for a company with a collaborative culture, a solid commitment to its employees and consumers, and a true desire to make a difference. 
-  	What I offer you in return is a highly skilled and experienced candidate who is known for collaborating across functions and groups, overcoming adversity, solving ambiguous problems, and calling upon a diverse background to parachute into any industry to provide a fresh perspective and deliver results.


I’m always open for a conversation or to answer questions about what you see (or might not see) here.
